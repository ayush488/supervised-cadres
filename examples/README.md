This folder contains several files showing how to perform analyses using the supervised  cadre model.

Contents:
* `short-example.py` is a short example mostly meant to ensure that you have all the correct dependencies
* `BinaryClassificationTuning.ipynb` is a notebook showing how to tune hyperparameters via parallelized cross validation, ensuring you have a good SCM
* `BinaryClassificationAssessment.ipynb` is a longer notebook showing how to apply an SCM once you've trained it with good hyperparameters
